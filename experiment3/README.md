# Experiment 3

In this experiment, your task is same like what you do in experiment 2, but you need to find a new may to do that. 

Also, if you have finished the experiment 2, you know how to solve the problem in real world. So it's easy for you to transfer the pre-process code to this experiment, we hope we can see the result in captcha or handwriting.

## Basic Task

* Task detail

  Find a algorithm , it can predict the number with digit image input, the digit image can be from captcha, handwriting and other real photo. 

* Dataset

  Emmmm, [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) again, don't be impatient with it because I promise it's must be last time you meet it in this course. You should test your algorithm in this dataset or evolve your code with it, the accuracy is also important part we are concerned about.

* Limitation

  In fact, we don't have a serious limitation about what you need to do... So try your best to do the last experiment!

### Option 1 - Without deep learning

In last experiment, you try to solve the problem with deep learning, but before we have strong network, how we deal with it? There are many traditional algorithms about classfication  problem, like SVM. It's useful for many specific problems and the ideas of these algorithms  maybe give you inspiration in your own project. So have a try.

### Option 2 - Advanced deep learning

You know, with MNIST dataset, it's easy to design a convolution network for classfication, but It's not we want in this experiment. You can try to find some advanced deep learning method to do this problem. Remind you, if you just add some batch-normalization layer, conv layer, it's not advanced network. How about capsule network? Yeah it's maybe ok but you must know why it is advanced and what's the advantage of this network. It's better if you can have a compare between the result from exp2 and exp3 in some more flexible case.
