# Experiment 1



In this experiment, I use kmeans & bikmeans to clustering some data.


file structure{
	run.py : the main function file.
	kmeans.py : the implementation of kmeans & bikmeans.
	./result : the result folder
	/data : the data folder
}



This was demonstrated that bikmeamns is useful in reduceing local best and has less amount of computation.
