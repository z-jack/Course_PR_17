# Experiment 2

In this experiment, we have a basic task and an advanced task.

## Basic Task

The basic task is **train a model to look at MINIST images and predict what digits they are, then check the model's accuracy with the test data.** 

As we all know, MNIST is a simple computer vision dataset. It consists of images of handwritten digits like these:

It also includes labels for each image, telling us which digit it is. For example, the labels for the above images are 5, 0, 4, and 1.  The MNIST data is hosted on [Yann LeCun's website](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).

*Please note that we do not restrict the program languages and allow to use libraries or tools.

## Advanced Task

We have two advanced tasks, you can choose one of them to complete: 

#### T1: Handwritten Digits Recognition in Real Photos 

Propose a method to extract handwritten numerals from real photos like these:

#### T2: Recognizing The CAPTCHA(Website Verification Code)

* Note this experiment is research/study only, do not apply real attack!

The traditional method of extracting pixel points one by one and template matching, can only recognize simple CAPTCHA.

Please propose a Neural Network based approach to recognizing the Verification Code (e.g., [the one used by SDU email](http://mail.sdu.edu.cn/?q=authreg)). You can choose a class of Verification Code to recognize and the training/testing dataset can be generated by yourself.
